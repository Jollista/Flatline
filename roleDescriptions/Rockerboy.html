							<h3>ROCKERBOY</h3>
							<p>
								If you live to rock, this is where you belong. As a Rockerboy, you're one of
								the street poets, the social conscience, and the rebels of the Time of the
								Red. With the advent of digital porta-studios and garage music master-
								ing, every Rockerboy with a message can take it to The Street, put it in the
								record stores, bounce it off the comsats. Sometimes, your message isn't
								something the Corporations or the government wants to hear. Sometimes
								what you say is going to get right in the faces of the powerful people
								who really want to run this world. But you don't care, because as a
								Rockerboy, you know it's your place to challenge authority, whether
								in straight-out protest songs that tell it like it is, playing kick-ass rock
								n' roll to get the people away from the TV sets and into The Streets,
								firing up the crowd with speeches, or composing fiery writings that
								shape the minds and hearts of millions. You have a proud history
								as a Rockerboy. Dylan, Springsteen, U2, NWA, the
								Who, Jett, the Stones—the legions of hard-rock
								heroes who told the truth with screaming guitars
								or gut-honest lyrics. You have the power to
								get the people up; to lead, inspire, and inform.
								Your message can give the timid courage, the weak
								strength, and the blind vision. Rockerboy legends like Johnny
								Silverhand, Rockerboy Manson (for whom the Role is named)
								and Kerry Eurodyne have led armies against Corporations and
								governments. Rockerboys have exposed corruption and brought
								down dictators. It's a lot of power for someone doing gigs every
								night in another city. But you can handle it. After all: you came
								to play!

							<h3>CHARISMATIC IMPACT</h3>
							<p>
								The Rockerboy's Role Ability is Charismatic Impact. With this
								ability, they can influence others by sheer presence of personality.
								They need not be a musical performer; they can influence others
								through poetry, art, dance, or simply their physical presence. They could
								be a rocker—or a cult leader. As they grow in skill, they can affect larger
								and larger groups and call on their fans for greater and greater requests
								of loyalty
