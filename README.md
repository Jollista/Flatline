# Cyberpunk RED Character Creation Tools
This repository contains a collection of tools that you can use to make characters in Cyberpunk Red, since I noticed some of my players had a bit of a tough time keeping track of some of their skill totals.

## Skills
Is a basic skill calculator for Cyberpunk RED. It initially prompts you for a maximum number of skill points, then you can go through the skill categories to add skills. At the end, when you're ready to stop, it'll display your skills for you to copy down onto a character sheet :)

Currently nonfunctional due to issues with array length calculation.
