				<h2>Streetrats (Templates):</h2>
				<p>
					If you've never roleplayed before or just want to get going
					without a lot of fuss, Templates are the fastest way to start creating a Character. But
					don't underestimate Templates! In the hands of an experienced roleplayer, even a tem-
					plate can be modified to make a unique and fully fleshed-out Character by expanding
					on the basics. By adding as you play, the Template gathers more individuality to itself,
					getting better and better the more you play.

				<h2>Edgerunners (Fast and Dirty):</h2>
				<p>
					As you'll soon realize, the Cyberpunk RED
					Character Generation system is designed to give you a lot of flexibility. You can tailor
					the Character the way you want it, with lots of personal touches all through the process.
					But when you need to create a Character quickly and without a lot of painstaking
					detail, the Fast and Dirty method is an excellent option.

				<h2>Complete Packages (Calculated):</h2>
				<p>
					The Calculated method is by far the most
					complex way to make a Cyberpunk RED Character. Yet the reward is the ability to
					create a Character that is exactly what you want, using pools of points to buy Statistics
					and Skills and starting money to buy weapons, armor, gear, and cyberware.
