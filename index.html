		<h2>Streetrats (Templates):</h2>
		<p>
			If you've never roleplayed before or just want to get going
			without a lot of fuss, Templates are the fastest way to start creating a Character. But
			don't underestimate Templates! In the hands of an experienced roleplayer, even a tem-
			plate can be modified to make a unique and fully fleshed-out Character by expanding
			on the basics. By adding as you play, the Template gathers more individuality to itself,
			getting better and better the more you play.

		<h2>Edgerunners (Fast and Dirty):</h2>
		<p>
			As you'll soon realize, the Cyberpunk RED
			Character Generation system is designed to give you a lot of flexibility. You can tailor
			the Character the way you want it, with lots of personal touches all through the process.
			But when you need to create a Character quickly and without a lot of painstaking
			detail, the Fast and Dirty method is an excellent option.

		<h2>Complete Packages (Calculated):</h2>
		<p>
			The Calculated method is by far the most
			complex way to make a Cyberpunk RED Character. Yet the reward is the ability to
			create a Character that is exactly what you want, using pools of points to buy Statistics
			and Skills and starting money to buy weapons, armor, gear, and cyberware.
