							<h3>ROCKERBOY</h3>
							<p>
								If you live to rock, this is where you belong. As a Rockerboy, you're one of
								the street poets, the social conscience, and the rebels of the Time of the
								Red. With the advent of digital porta-studios and garage music master-
								ing, every Rockerboy with a message can take it to The Street, put it in the
								record stores, bounce it off the comsats. Sometimes, your message isn't
								something the Corporations or the government wants to hear. Sometimes
								what you say is going to get right in the faces of the powerful people
								who really want to run this world. But you don't care, because as a
								Rockerboy, you know it's your place to challenge authority, whether
								in straight-out protest songs that tell it like it is, playing kick-ass rock
								n' roll to get the people away from the TV sets and into The Streets,
								firing up the crowd with speeches, or composing fiery writings that
								shape the minds and hearts of millions. You have a proud history
								as a Rockerboy. Dylan, Springsteen, U2, NWA, the
								Who, Jett, the Stones—the legions of hard-rock
								heroes who told the truth with screaming guitars
								or gut-honest lyrics. You have the power to
								get the people up; to lead, inspire, and inform.
								Your message can give the timid courage, the weak
								strength, and the blind vision. Rockerboy legends like Johnny
								Silverhand, Rockerboy Manson (for whom the Role is named)
								and Kerry Eurodyne have led armies against Corporations and
								governments. Rockerboys have exposed corruption and brought
								down dictators. It's a lot of power for someone doing gigs every
								night in another city. But you can handle it. After all: you came
								to play!
							</p>
							<h3>CHARISMATIC IMPACT</h3>
							<p>
								The Rockerboy's Role Ability is Charismatic Impact. With this
								ability, they can influence others by sheer presence of personality.
								They need not be a musical performer; they can influence others
								through poetry, art, dance, or simply their physical presence. They could
								be a rocker—or a cult leader. As they grow in skill, they can affect larger
								and larger groups and call on their fans for greater and greater requests
								of loyalty

						<div class="dropdown-content-desc">
							<h3>SOLO</h3>
							<p>
								You were reborn with a gun in your hand—the flesh and blood hand—not
								the metallic weapons factory that covers most of your other arm. Whether
								as a freelance guard and killer-for-hire, or as one of the Corporate
								cybersoldiers who enforce business deals and the Company's "black
								operations," you're one of the elite fighting machines of the Time of
								the Red. Most Solos put in military time during the 4th Corporate
								War, in a Corporate army, or in one of the government's current
								"police actions" around the country. As the battle damage piles
								up, you start to rely more and more upon tech: cyberlimbs for
								weapons and armor, bio-program chips to increase your reflexes
								and awareness, combat drugs to give you that edge over your
								opponents. When you're the best of the best, you might even
								leave the ranks of Corporate samurai and go ronin—freelanc-
								ing your lethal talents as a killer, bodyguard, or enforcer to
								whoever can pay your very high fees. Sounds good? There's a
								price—a heavy one. You've lost so much of your original meat
								body that you're almost a machine. Your killing reflexes are
								so jacked up that you have to restrain yourself from going
								berserk at any moment. Years of combat drugs taken to
								keep the edge have given you terrifying addictions. There
								are few people you can trust anymore. One night you might
								sleep in a penthouse condo in the City, the next in a filthy
								alley on The Street. But that's the price of being the best. And
								you're willing to pay it. Because you're a Solo.
							</p>
							<h3>COMBAT AWARENESS</h3>
							<p>
								The Solo's Role Ability is Combat Awareness. With Combat
								Awareness, a Solo can call up their training to have an
								enhanced situational awareness of the battlefield. When
								combat begins, anytime outside of combat, or in combat
								with an Action, a Solo may divide the total number of
								points they have in their Combat Awareness Role Ability
								among a number of combat abilities. If a Solo chooses
								to not change their point assignments, their previous ones
								persist. Activating some of these abilities will cost the Solo
								more points than others.

					<!--NETRUNNER-->
					<a onclick="selectRole('Netrunner')" onmouseover="loadImage('images/Netrunner.png')" onmouseout="loadImage()">Netrunner
						<div class="dropdown-content-desc">
							<h3>NETRUNNER</h3>
							<p>
								You're a brain-burning computer hacker & master of the Post-NET cyberverse
								in the Time of the Red. At three, your parents bought you an old Kirama
								LPD-12 cyberdeck with Zetatech 526 optical goggles (you were too
								young for interface plugs), and your life was changed. By fifth grade,
								you were already using REFRAME-G1s meta-programming to crack
								into the school district's system and change your grades. When you
								were thirteen, you shifted enough funds out of unprotected Trans
								United Bank accounts to finance your first neural interface
								plugs. You couldn't wait to run high and fast with the other gods
								of the NET—Bartmoss, Magnificent Curtis, and the rest. Then
								the 4th Corp War blew the Old NET apart. The R.A.B.I.D.S.
								made NET travel a suicide run; the Nodes were fragmented or cor-
								rupted. But there were still places to run. You just had to go there and jack in
								the hard way. You traded in sitting on the couch for a Bodyweight combat
								bodysuit and Virtuality 5 interface goggles to mesh NET with Meatspace.
								The systems you cracked were smaller, but even deadlier. Now, you're
								really part of a team, with Solos to cover your back, Medtechs to restart
								your heart if the ICE gets you, and Techs to help you hot-wire your cyber-
								deck for more speed and software deployment. Now, nothing can stop you.
								As an electronic wraith, you slip into the "hardest" mainframe systems with
								ease: stealing, trading, and selling their deepest secrets at will. The Black
								ICE may still kill you in the end, but until the ride runs out you'll be there,
								bare-brained and headfirst in the New NET.
							</p>
							<h3>INTERFACE</h3>
							<p>
								The Netrunner's Role Ability is Interface. Interface is what allows the
								Netrunner to Netrun—to interface with electronic mind-modems (called
								cyberdecks) to control computers, electronics, and associated program -
								ming. The Interface Role Ability also gives the Netrunner access to a
								wide suite of Abilities related to computer hacking and system control.

					<!--TECH-->
					<a onclick="selectRole('Tech')" onmouseover="loadImage('images/Tech.png')" onmouseout="loadImage()">Tech
						<div class="dropdown-content-desc">
							<h3>TECH</h3>
							<p>
								You can't leave anything alone—if it sits near you for more than
								five minutes, you've disassembled it and made it into something
								new. You've always got at least two screwdrivers and a wrench in
								your pockets. Computer down? No problem. Hydrogen burner out in
								your Metrocar? No problem. Can't get the video to run or your interface
								glitching? No problem. You make your living building, fixing, and modi-
								fying—a crucial occupation in a technological world recovering from
								a War that broke the back of the supply chain. You can make some
								good bucks fixing everyday stuff, but for the serious money you
								need to tackle the big jobs. Illegal weapons. Illegal or stolen
								cybertech. Corporate espionage and counter-espionage gear
								for "black operations." If you're any good, you're making a lot
								of money. And that money goes into new gadgets, hardware,
								and information. Your black market work isn't just making you
								friends—it's also racking you up an impressive number of enemies
								as well—so you invest a lot in defense systems and, if really pushed
								to the wall, call in a few markers on a Solo or two. You've fixed
								up tech for everybody from black ops Corporate samurai to Ms.
								Zepada down the block. No one's ever come back to you with a
								complaint but that might be because of the turrets guarding your
								front door. You're addicted to technology in all its forms and
								that's what makes you a Tech.
							</p>
							<h3>MAKER</h3>
							<p>
								The Tech's Role Ability is Maker. Using the Maker Role Ability,
								the Tech can fix, improve, modify, make, and invent new items.
								Whenever a Tech increases their Maker Rank by one, they gain
								one rank in two different Maker Specialties of their choice, including
								repairing, upgrading, fabricating, and inventing.

					<!--MEDTECH-->
					<a onclick="selectRole('Medtech')" onmouseover="loadImage('images/Medtech.png')" onmouseout="loadImage()">Medtech
						<div class="dropdown-content-desc">
							<h3>MEDTECH</h3>
							<p>
								You're an artist, and the human body is your canvas. You've got the best tools
								the Time of the Red can offer, and you know how to use them. If you're lucky,
								you got to attend one of the real med schools scattered around the wreck of the
								Old United States. And after the War, military hospitals were everywhere and
								the few doctors on the war front needed helping hands to hold down screaming
								patients and splice cyberware back together. So, maybe you learned that
								way.
								
								<br>And there's always an old ripperdoc or two out there who hearken
								back to that old science fiction story called The Bladerunner—not
								that old flatscreen vid, but the really old sci-fi book about renegade
								doctors who performed illegal street surgery in one of the first dys-
								topian novels. Maybe one of those guys trained you. Maybe that's
								where you are right now, patching up the wounded, mending up
								the sick, and keeping the locals alive. For love, commitment, or
								maybe a just a fat payday on the side.

								<br>If you're really lucky, you've scored a berth in the local Trauma
								Team franchise. Trauma Teams are groups of licensed paramedi-
								cals who patrol the city looking for patients. You operate from an
								AV-4 Urban Assault Vehicle, redesigned into an ambulance con-
								figuration, and armed with a belly-mounted minigun. It's the best
								of the best—Trauma Team charges some heavy subscription fees
								to save its clients, and that translates into new medical toys, faster
								AV ambulances, and hefty salaries for the best surgeons around.
								
								<br>It doesn't matter how you got here. What matters is that you're
								here, on The Street, doing the job. And you'd be doing it no matter
								what the reason. It's what marks you as a Medtech.
							</p>
							<h3>MEDICINE</h3>
							<p>
								The Medtech's Role Ability is Medicine. With this ability,
								Medtechs can keep people alive who should be dead with
								their knowledge, tools, and training. In the Time of the Red,
								they are as much doctors as they are mechanics, caring for
								people who are often more machine than human. Whenever
								the Medtech increases their Medicine Rank, they also
								choose one of three Medicine Specialties to allocate a
								single point to: surgery, pharmaceuticals, or cryosystems
								operation.

					<!--MEDIA-->
					<a onclick="selectRole('Media')" onmouseover="loadImage('images/Media.png')" onmouseout="loadImage()">Media
						<div class="dropdown-content-desc">
							<h3>MEDIA</h3>
							<p>
								They're bending the truth out there. And you're going to stop
								them. Someone has to do it. The Corporations used to rule the
								world. They dumped toxics, destabilized economies, and com-
								mitted murder with equal impunity. The government back then
								couldn't even stop them—hell, they owned the government.
								But then the War came.

								<br>The War stripped away the facade and let us all know exactly
								what had been going on under our noses. And the people who made
								sure we all knew the score were the Medias. That's you. You've
								got a vidlink and a press pass, and you're not afraid to use them.
								You're a city-wide figure, seen nightly all over the Data Pool in the
								Time of the Red. It's not like the old days, when you had a major
								Mediacorp behind you; this time, you've gotta depend on your
								fans, your contacts, and your own reputation. But it's harder for
								these new Corps to make you disappear. So when you dig down
								for the dirt and slime the corrupt officials and Corporate lapdogs
								try to cover up, you can dig deep. The next morning, you can put
								the details of their crimes all over the screamsheets and vidscreens.
								Three or four times, the bad guys have tried to kill you—that's why
								your backup's a crack Solo bodyguard and you've got one of the
								top ‘Runners in the business digging through NET Architectures to
								back your stories. You have to be good, or else.
								
								<br>Your ‘Runner's just phoned in with a hot lead. You grab your gear
								and flag your backup. You're going to break those bastards. This time,
								for sure.
							</p>
							<h3>CREDIBILITY</h3>
							<p>
								The Media's Role Ability is Credibility. The Media can not only
								convince an audience of the truth of what they publish but also has
								a larger audience the more credible they are. Medias also have
								greater levels of access to sources and information; they are always
								in the know with their ears to the ground to pick up on rumors and
								information passively.

					<!--EXEC-->

						<div class="dropdown-content-desc">
							<h3>EXEC</h3>
							<p>
								In the old days before the Time of the Red, you would have been a hard-
								driven, fast-track MBA on their way up the Corporate ladder. Sure, it was
								selling your soul to the Company, but face it: the Corporations ruled the
								world. They controlled governments, markets, nations, armies—you name
								it. And you knew that whoever controlled the Corporations controlled
								everything else. But things changed when the largest Megacorps
								on the planet got into a major war that was equal to anything any
								real national governments could have thrown down.
								
								<br>Okay, so right now your life as a junior executive is any-
								thing but easy. There are those underneath you who'd kill
								for a shot at your job. Literally. There are those over you
								who'd kill to keep you out of their jobs. Literally. And they're
								not kidding about the killing—every up-and-comer in the
								Corporation has their own Team of Solos and Netrunners
								to cover important pet projects. Last week, you led a mixed
								team of Solos, Netrunners, and Techs on a headhunting run to
								"extract" a researcher from a rival company. You told yourself
								you joined the Corporation to make it a better place—work
								from the inside, you said. Or just until you could start your
								own Corporation that would be...a little more honest. But now
								you're not so sure. Your ideals are a little tarnished and things
								are getting pretty bleak. But you can't worry about ethics
								now. You've got a report due in an hour, and it looks like that
								guy in sales is planning to ice your database for good.
								
								<br>You're gonna ice him first.
							</p>
							<h3>TEAMWORK</h3>
							<p>
								The Exec's Role Ability is Teamwork. Just like a real corporate
								executive, the Exec builds a team whose members help them
								accomplish their goals, whether legal or not, morale permit-
								ting. Team members have a visible job description (like secre-
								tary or driver) but also have a covert roles (such as Netrunner,
								bodyguard, or assassin). Plus they get free housing and nice
								set of clothes!

						<div class="dropdown-content-desc">
							<h3>LAWMAN</h3>
							<p>
								In the old days before the War, they only used to shoot at cops. Now you're lucky
								if you just take a slug. The Street is mean these days, filled with new drugs, new
								gangs, and new weapons that make a Minami-10 look like a kid's toy. But even so,
								you're out there doing what you can to Protect—and Serve.
								
								<br>There used to be a big City Force, but most of the Old Guard in NCPD have been
								thrown out on their own to keep what peace they can. The ones who remain still
								take the Badge seriously; they work to keep people safe and make some kind of
								stand against chaos. Even if you'd rather just walk a beat, if you're a professional
								Lawman of any stripe, you're stuck carrying at least four high-caliber weapons,
								most of them full-auto types, wearing a Kevlar ® vest that'll stop 850ft/lbs.
								per square inch—and often you're still outgunned and outflanked. Half the
								gangs were cybered up to begin with: super speed, super reflexes, could
								see in the dark, carried weapons in their arms...and that was before the
								War and the Fall of the Towers pumped a metric ton of milspec cybertech
								into the Night Markets. The other half of the guys on The Street are free-
								lance Corporate mercs who used to have jobs during the War; hired
								to enforce Corp armies disbanded by the New United States' goon
								squads. Now they're the goon squads and you're trying to keep
								them under control too. Used to be the Corporate Cops had heavy
								weapons, full combat armor, Trauma Team backup, AV-4 assault
								vehicles, and gyrocopters with miniguns. But the nice, clean sectors
								full of new office buildings and fancy restaurants—where no jacked-up
								psychopunk is going to ever go on a killing spree with an FN-RAL37—are
								mostly gone. Now you've got mostly burned-out buildings and abandoned
								cars, where every night is a new firefight and another great opportunity for
								a messy death. Or you might draw a Psycho Squad berth and get the job
								of hunting down heavily armed and armored cyborgs who've flipped out. A
								cyberpsycho can walk through machine gun fire and not even feel it, so a lot of
								the Psycho Squad become a bit crazy themselves; they load up with boosted
								reflexes, get some monstrously huge guns, and go hunt the cyborgs solo. But
								you're not that crazy. Yet.
							</p>
							<h3>BACKUP</h3>
							<p>
								The Lawman's Role Ability is Backup. With this ability, Lawmen can call upon
								the help of a group of fellow officers, based on the Lawman's Rank and the
								conditions under which they make the call. This Backup is armed and armored
								based on their Rank.

					<!--FIXER-->
					<a onclick="selectRole('Fixer')" onmouseover="loadImage('images/Fixer.png')" onmouseout="loadImage()">Fixer
						<div class="dropdown-content-desc">
							<h3>FIXER</h3>
							<p>
								You realized fast that you weren't ever going to get a Corporate job or be tough
								enough to be a Solo. But you always knew you had a knack for figuring out
								what other people wanted, and how to get it for them. For a price, of course.
								Now your deals have moved past the nickel-and-dime stuff into the big time.
								Maybe you move illegal weapons over the border. Or steal and resell medical
								supplies. Perhaps you're a skill broker acting as an agent for high-priced
								Solos and 'Runners, or even hiring a whole Nomad pack to back a client's
								contracts. You buy and sell favors like an old-style Mafia godfather. You
								have connections into all kinds of businesses, deals, and political groups. You
								use your contacts and allies as part of a vast web of intrigue and coercion.
								If there's a hot nightclub in the City, you've bought into it. If there are
								military-class weapons on The Street, you smuggled ‘em in. If there's a
								faction war going down, you're negotiating between sides with an
								eye on the main chance. But you're not entirely in it for the bucks.
								If someone needs to get the heat off, you'll hide them. You get
								people housing when there isn't any, and you bring in food
								when the streets are blockaded. Maybe you do it because
								you know they'll owe you later, but you're not sure. You're
								one part Robin Hood and two parts AI Capone. In the past,
								they would have called you a crime lord. But this is the
								fragmented, nasty, deadly Time of the Red. So now they
								call you a Fixer.
							</p>
							<h3>OPERATOR</h3>
							<p>
								The Fixer's Role Ability is Operator. Fixers know how to get things on the
								black market and are adept at navigating the complex social customs of
								The Street, where hundreds of cultures and economic levels collide. Fixers
								maintain vast webs of contacts and clients who they can reach out to source
								goods, favors, or information. Fixers can also source desirable resources
								and make favorable deals.

					<!--NOMAD-->

						<div class="dropdown-content-desc">
							<h3>NOMAD</h3>
							<p>
								Years ago, the Corps drove your family off the farm. They rolled in, took over the
								land, and put rent-a-cops all over the place. But that was before the War. You
								were loners, homeless, until you created a Nomad Pack of nearly two-hundred
								members. Back then, your Pack was crammed into a huge, ragtag fleet of
								cars, vans, buses, and RVs roaming the freeways looking for supplies, odd
								jobs, and spare parts in a fragmented world. The Pack was your home—it
								had teachers, Medtechs, leaders, and mechanics—a virtual town on
								wheels in which everyone was related by marriage or kinship. But in
								the Time of the Red, your Nomad Pack has evolved. Your knowledge
								of roadcraft—of how to get between the safezones over the savage
								highways has allowed you to become the masters of getting
								people, supplies, and materials to a world that desperately
								needs them. Your cousins on the open seas have taken over
								the huge container ships and turned them into the Nomad
								convoys keeping civilization running. Your Deltajock fam-
								boys keep the supply lines to the Orbital Highriders open. If
								it has to get somewhere and get there safely, Nomads get
								the job done. Your vehicles are well-armored and bristling
								with stolen weapons: miniguns, rocket launchers, and the
								like. Every kid knows how to use a rifle, and everyone
								packs a knife. Like modern-day cowboys, you ride the
								hard trail. You've got a gun, a bike, and your Family, and
								that's all you need. You're a Nomad.
							</p>
							<h3>MOTO</h3>
							<p>
								The Nomad's Role Ability is Moto. Whenever a Nomad increases
								their Rank in Moto, they have the option of adding another stock
								vehicle (with minimum specs) of their Moto Rank or lower to the
								pool of Family vehicles they have permission to use from the
								Family Motorpool or to make an upgrade to one of their
								current vehicles. Thanks to being around vehicles since birth,
								Nomads are also able to drive any type of vehicle with
								tremendous skill.

								Self-adaptive-AI powered smartphone; that
								"learns" how best to fit your needs simply by inter-
								acting with you. While not a true AI, it is more than
								capable of replacing any need for a secretary. When
								you sit back and allow your Agent to manage your
								life, everything is easier, including making sure you
								have time to do what you need to do (crimes, killing
								people, getting away with it, and so forth) instead of
								going to the store to get something you forgot. There
								are many reasons why almost everyone has one.
								Things your Agent can do:
								
								<ul>
									<li>
										Make phone calls in voice or video and record
										them, forward them, or send them to voicemail,
										which pretty much only Agents actually end up
										listening to nowadays.
									</li>
									<li>
										Surf the Data Pool.
									</li>
									<li>
										Scan the Data Pool to locate a known location
										and bring up directions.
									</li>
									<li>
										Keep your schedule for you and act inde-
										pendently on events, like ordering a gift and
										having it delivered to the recipient.
									</li>
									<li>
										Maintain a personality complete with name,
										voice, and virtual body. Some particularly lonely
										individuals reprogram their Agents to act as sur-
										rogate lovers or friends.
									</li>
									<li>
										Suggest clothes for you to buy.
									</li>
									<li>
										Record audio and video to the Agent's standard
										Memory Chip.
									</li>
									<li>
										Link to your Cyberware to share data storage with
										them and the Agent's Memory Chip.
									</li>
									<li>
										Link to most appliances in your living space.
									</li>
									<li>
										Monitor your use of easily acquired resources
										(Cheap, Everyday, or Costly) and automatically
										reorder them when you get low at market price.
									</li>
									<li>
										Recommend a future course of action based on
										your personal goals. AI may suggest unwise
										actions.
									</li>
								</ul>

								In addition to all this, <b>an Agent gives the user +2
								to their Library Search Skill and +2 to their
								Wardrobe & Style Skill</b>, but only if you wear the
								clothes your Agent suggests for you, which change
								every season. Multiple Agents don't multiply these
								bonuses.
